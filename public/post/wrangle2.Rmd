## Strings
Package: `library(stringr)`

1. Creation:

```
x <- "Richard Stallman doesn't mind if you read his mail as long as you don't delete it before he reads it. "

y <- 'Richard Stallman met Chuck Norris once. Chuck tried a roundhouse, but Richard bashed him 
in the skull.'
```  

Try creating this string  

```
'Richard Stallman's beard trimmings can cure cancer. Too bad he never shaves.'
```  

2. Escaping quotes to have quotes inside quotes 

```
'Richard Stallman\'s beard trimmings can cure cancer. Too bad he never shaves.'
"Richard Stallman gets \"9 bits\" to the byte."  
```  

3. Use `writeLines` as opposed to `print` to show the actual string  

```
writeLines("Richard Stallman gets \"9 bits\" to the byte.")
```  

4. Special cases:  
- "\\n"	newline  
- "\\r"	carriage return  
- "\\t"	tab  

5. Create a vector of strings:

```
c("a", "b", "d")
```

6. Number of characters (length):

```
str_length(
 c("Richard Stallman can solve the halting problem... in polynomial time.", NA)
)
```

7. Combine strings:

```
str_c("hello", c("there", "here"), sep = " ")
str_c("hello", c("there", "here", ""), sep = " ", collapse = " ")

x <- "Class"
str_c(
  x,
  "is ...",
  if (wday(Sys.time(), label = TRUE) == "Mon") "on" else "off",
  sep = " "
)
```

8. Sub-strings:

```
str_sub("Richard Stallman did not write GNU Emacs, he simply read the source code from /dev/null.", start = 1, end = 7)

str_sub("Richard Stallman did not write GNU Emacs, he simply read the source code from /dev/null.", start = -6, end = -1)
```

9. String case:

```
str_to_lower("LARGE LETTERS")
str_to_upper("SMALL LETTERS")
```

10. String sort:

```
str_sort(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Saturday"))
```

Exercise:

Fix the following strings if needed, lower their case, then combine them with newline character to show one quote per line, and finally get the length of the full string.

```
'Richard Stallman doesn't need sudo. I will make him a sandwich anyway.'
"Richard Stallman's beard is made of parentheses."
```

11. Regular expression:  

I often refer to this [cheatsheet](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) to remind myself of syntax. I will show only simple examples as it is better learned piece by piece as needed.

- a-b 0-9 Alpha-numerical characters
```
x <- "zip code 60099"
str_extract(string = x, pattern = "zip code")
str_detect(string = x, pattern = "60099")
str_replace(string = x, pattern = "60099", replacement = "60000")
str_split(string = x, pattern = " ")
```
- !-) Special symbols may need escaping if they are regex syntax
```
x <- "zip code @ (#60099)"
str_extract(string = x, pattern = "\\(")
str_detect(string = x, pattern = "#")
str_replace(string = x, pattern = "@", replacement = "")
str_split(string = x, pattern = " ")
```

- . One of any symbols
```
x <- "zip code @ (#60099)."
str_extract(string = x, pattern = "z.p")
str_detect(string = x, pattern = "co.e")
str_replace_all(string = x, pattern = "\\.", replacement = "!")
str_split(string = x, pattern = ".")
```

- `\d \s [abc] [^123]`
```
x <- "zip code @ (#60099).\n"
str_replace_all(string = x, pattern = "\\s", replacement = " ")
str_detect(string = x, pattern = "[@#]")
str_extract_all(string = x, pattern = "[^@#()]")
```

- ^ $ Anchors
```
x <- "truth is truth"
str_replace_all(string = x, pattern = "^truth", replacement = "lie")
str_replace_all(string = x, pattern = "truth$", replacement = "lie")
```

- | multiple patterns
```
x <- "zip code @ (#60099).\n"
str_replace_all(string = x, pattern = "\\d|[@#()]", replacement = "")
```

- ? + * Quantifiers
```
x <- "groowthh"
str_extract_all(string = x, pattern = "o+")
str_detect(string = x, pattern = "o+w?th*")
```
