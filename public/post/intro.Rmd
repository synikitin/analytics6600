## Analytics Producer:

- Roles: Data scientists, software developers, infrastructure engineers, business analysts, subject matter experts
- Backgrounds: Math/stats, social sciences, economics, computer science
- Skills: Math/statistics, communications, domain expertise, “end-to-end”
- Key Attributes: Curiosity, a desire to learn, a willingness to get hands dirty
- Culture: Work in close proximity, exposure to variety of problems, safe to question, acceptable failure rate

## Analytics Client:

- Available data and an SME (can someone plug in a laptop and query the data?)
- Business lead (provides guidance, removes roadblocks, serves as sounding board)
- Quantifying the value to be created
- Understanding the existing workflow (flowcharts are your friend)
- Access to a real live user in the wild
- Well-defined scope, in writing
- Frequent communications with feedback (design sessions)
